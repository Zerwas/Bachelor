\section*{Preface}
If we have a finite group of matrices, then we can equip it with the rank metric and the normalized Haar measure to obtain a \emph{metric measure space}.

Carderi and Thom  showed in \cite{thom} that the limit of $\SL_n$ is \emph{extremely amenable}. The goal of this thesis is to generalize this result to limits of other matrix group families, namely unitary, symplectic, and orthogonal matrices. The general strategy will be the following: given a family $(G_n)_{n\in\N}$ of (mm) matrix groups we first find an upper bound for the \emph{concentration function} of $G_n$ using a consequence of Azemas inequality \cite{Azema book}. As the upper bounds converge to zero we conclude that $(G_n)_{n\in\N}$ is a \emph{L\'{e}vy family}, making their limit a \emph{L\'{e}vy group}. Finally, we know from \cite{29} that every L\'{e}vy group is extremely amenable.

\section{Introduction}

Define limit of $G_n$

Examples of matrices in the limit

structure of thesis:

%extreme amenabiliy
1. Azema

2. Thoms proof (matrices as automorphisms but without form)

3. want to generalize this so we need a form Hence extending the automorphism becomes harder so use Witts lemma

4. generalized version of the proof

5. application coloring theorem


\section{Limits of matrix groups and extreme amenability}
Let $\GL_n(q)$ be the general linear group over the $q$ element field $\F_q$ and let $G$ be a subgroup of $\GL_n(q)$. We can equip $G$ with the (normalized) \define{rank-metric} $d(g,h):=\frac{1}{n}\rank(g-h)$. Since all matrices in $G$ have full rank, this metric is left- and right-invariant, i.e. $d(kg,kh)=d(g,h)=d(gk,hk)$ for all $g,h,k\in G$. Let $G_n\leq \GL_{2^n}(q)$ be a family of subgroups, such that 
$\begin{pmatrix}
g &0\\
0&g
\end{pmatrix}\in G_{n+1}$ for all $g\in G_n$. Note that the map
\[\varphi_n\colon G_n\mapsto G_{n+1}\text{, where }\varphi_n(g)=\begin{pmatrix}
g &0\\
0&g
\end{pmatrix}\]
is an isometric homomorphism for all $n\in\N$. Hence we can define the inductive limit of $G_n$ ... We denote the metric completion of this limit by ...
