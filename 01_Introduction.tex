\section*{Preface}
If we have a finite group of matrices, then we can equip it with the rank metric and the normalized Haar measure to obtain a \emph{metric measure space}.
Carderi and Thom  showed in \cite{thom} that the limit of $\SL_n$ is \emph{extremely amenable}. The goal of this thesis is to generalize this result to limits of other matrix group families, namely unitary, symplectic, and orthogonal matrices. The general strategy will be the following, given a family $(G_n)_{n\in\N}$ of (mm) matrix groups we first find an upper bound for the \emph{concentration function} of $G_n$ using a consequence of Azemas inequality \cite{Azema book}. As the upper bounds converge to zero we conclude that $(G_n)_{n\in\N}$ is a \emph{L\'{e}vy family}, making their limit a \emph{L\'{e}vy group}. Finally, we know from \cite{29} that every L\'{e}vy group is extremely amenable.

\section{Introduction}

Define limit of $G_n$

Examples of matrices in the limit

structure of thesis:

1. Azema

2. Thoms proof (matrices as automorphisms but without form)

3. want to generalize this so we need a form Hence extending the automorphism becomes harder so use Witts lemma

4. generalized version of the proof
